# Infrastructure
Infrastructure using Terraform

The purpose of this repo is to show a full Softlayer Infrastructure environment built using the Terraform automation. We will create everything you need from scratch: subnets, routes, an virtual machine with MySQL installed inside a private network, and a webapp machine with Apache and its PHP module in a public subnet. The webapp machine reads a table in the database and shows the result.
